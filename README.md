## InteligentGameAgent
We worked on doing a Bayesian network using the netica API to calculate the next state for our artificial agent.

## Run
Probably if you haven't got the Netica API this project don't will work fine on your machine, but you can acquire [here](https://www.norsys.com/netica-j.html).

1. You have to copy the netica API to the root system path
2. Go to `NeticaJ_504\bin\x64_bin`
3. Copy all files on previous path

If you have any more doubt, you can consult the [Netica API Guide](http://www.norsys.com/netica-j/docs/NeticaJ_Man.pdf)
